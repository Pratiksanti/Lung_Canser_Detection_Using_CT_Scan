# Lung Cancer Detection Using CT Scan

## Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting lung cancer from CT scan images using deep learning models.
It combines a **MERN stack web application** with a **Python-based machine learning pipeline**
to assist in early and accurate lung cancer detection.

The system allows doctors to upload CT scan images and receive predictions generated by trained
deep learning models such as **VGG16**, **ResNet50**, and **InceptionV3**.
